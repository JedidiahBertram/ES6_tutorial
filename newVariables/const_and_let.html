      //Temporal dead zone
      // Temporal dead zone is basically the concept of not being able to access a variable before it is defined.
      // The following console log will throw an error because pizza is defined after the console log.

      // console.log(pizza);
      // let pizza = 'deep dish';

      //GENERAL RULE for what I like with var, let and const:
      // Use var for top level variables that are shared across many (especially larger) scopes.
      // Use let for localized variables in smaller scopes
      // Refactor let to const only after some code has been written and you're reasonably sure there will not need
      // to be variable reassignment.
